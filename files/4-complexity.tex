\todo{Some complexity results.
Probably: well-founded/KK: polynomially computable (data complexity), stable fixpoints: NP-complete, ... Copy results from logic programming basically. Similarly, complexity increases if we start using ultimate approximators}

To establish lower bounds for the complexity of computing the different semantics of AICs, we use a reduction from simple logic programs to AICs, as defined in~\cite{tplp/CaropreseT11}.
A simple logic program is one where rules are not trivial tautologies, i.e., they do not contain contradictory atoms in their bodies and they do not include their head in their body.

The operator $\aicop$ from~\cite{tplp/CaropreseT11} is defined as follows: if $r$ is the logic programming rule $a\leftarrow \ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, then $\aicop(r)$ is ${+a}\leftarrow \ell_1\wedge\ldots\wedge\ell_n\wedge\neg a$.
Given a logic program $P$, we define $\aicop(P)=\bigcup\{\aicop(r)\mid r\in P\}$.
Those authors then prove that the answer set semantics for $P$ coincides with the justified repair semantics for $\aicop(P)$ (with respect to the empty database).

More generally, with this definition it is immediate that the operator $\threeap_{\langle\emptyset,\aicop(P)\rangle}$ coincides with the corresponding operator $T_P$, used to define AFT semantics for logic programs.
\luis{I'm a bit uncertain about the notation here, so I'm using $T_P$ as a placeholder for something with the right font.  Does it suffice to say that $\Ap$ coincides with $\Psi_P$?}
This immediately implies that each semantics for AIC defined from $\Apfull$ has at least the same complexity as the corresponding semantics for logic programs.

\bart{Lower bound for stable: every normal logic program can be seen  as an AIC. Should have te same stable smeantics (note: our transformation in theprevious section adds rules 
\[a\lrule a\] but these do not change stable models. 

Lower bounds for KK well-founded. Well...polytime upper bound is al that needs to be sshown?}
