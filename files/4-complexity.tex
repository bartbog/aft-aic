\todo{Some complexity results.
Probably: well-founded/KK: polynomially computable (data complexity), stable fixpoints: NP-complete, ... Copy results from logic programming basically. Similarly, complexity increases if we start using ultimate approximators}

\luis{The plan: recall the translation \mathsf{aic} from the Caroprese paper, show that the operator we use to define fixpoints is preserved by this operator, get upper bounds for all complexity problems.  For lower bounds I need to think a bit more.}
