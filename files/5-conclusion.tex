In this paper, we defined an approximator for active integrity constraints. 
The result is a family of semantics for AICs based on existing intuitions in various domains of non-monotonic reasoning. 
In particular the AFT-well-founded semantics possesses desirable properties: it approximates all repairs of various families (stable, justified, grounded) and hence can be used for approximate skeptical query-answering with respect to any of these semantics. 
Furthermore, the AFT-well-founded repair can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the database. 

Our study is far from finished. 
In the context of approximation fixpoint theory, \emph{ultimate approximators} have been studied by \citet{DeneckerMT04}. 
They showed that with each two-valued operator, we can associate a canonical approximator. 
The ultimate approximator induces another family of semantics for AICs. 
In other domains, e.g., in logic programming, semantics based on ultimate approximators have some very desirable properties, but in general come at the cost of a higher computational complexity than their ``standard'' variants. 
It remains to be researched if the same holds in the context of AICs. 
In this paper, we showed that the class of justified repairs is situated in between the classes of stable and of grounded repairs. 
It is known from AFT that the class of ultimate stable fixpoints also falls in between the classes of stable fixpoints (for any approximator) and grounded fixpoints \mycite{GroundedFixpoints}. 
Hence, an interesting research question would be to verify if justified repairs coincide with ultimate stable fixpoints in this domain, and if not, how they relate. 
One last topic on which more extensive research might be needed is the domain of revision programming \cite{tcs/MarekT98}. \citet{tplp/CaropreseT11} showed structural correspondences between semantics for AICs and semantics for revision programs. 
Our paper now paves the way to applying AFT to revision programming as well.

% It also holds that

% So the question naturally arises: how do justified repairs compare to ultimate stable fixpoints. Also, the u-wff is more precise than the standard wff. So it gives us more information and can also be useful in practice.
