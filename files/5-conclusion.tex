\todo{Say something about future work:

ultimate approximations. Currently, we found
$stable \subseteq justified\subseteq grounded$ and all these inclusions can be strict. 
It also holds that 
$stable \subseteq ult-stable\subseteq grounded$ and all these inclusions can be strict. 
So the question naturally arises: how do justified repairs compare to ultimate stable fixpoints. Also, the u-wff is more precise than the standard wff. So it gives us more information and can also be useful in practice.
