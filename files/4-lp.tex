\bart{I don't know how valuable the following result is. }
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:lplink}
 If $\db=\emptyset$, and the only update actions in \aics are of the form $\add a$, then, consider the following logic program: 
 \begin{align*}
  \PP =& \{a \lrule \nup(r)\mid r\in \aics, \head(r)= \add a\}\\
  &\cup \{a \lrule a\mid a \in \atoms\}
 \end{align*}
then $\Ap = \Psi_\PP$. 

Hence, all AFT semantics for \fulldb coincide in this case with the equally-named semantics for the logic program \PP. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 \todo{case analysis on the definition of \Ap. 
 The condition on \fulldb guarantees that $\suppout$ is always false.}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
 Proposition \ref{prop:lplink} does not hold in general, not even for unipolar \aics. 
 Consider for instance the following sets of \aics. 
 \begin{align*}\eta_1 &= \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                    a &\aicrule \remove a\\
                    b & \aicrule \remove b
                   \end{array}\right.\\
                   \eta_2 &=\emptyset.
\end{align*}
These two are not equivalent under all AFT semantics. 
For the first one, the KK-repair is $\{a\mapsto\lunkn,b\mapsto\lunkn\}$, while for the latter, the KK-repair is $\{a\mapsto\lfalse,b\mapsto\lfalse\}$. However, they have the same translation to logic programs.
