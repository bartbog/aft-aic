\subsection{AIC and Logic Programs}

\bart{I don't know how valuable the following result is. }
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:lplink}
  Suppose that $\db=\emptyset$ and that the only update actions in \aics are of the form $\add a$.
  If $\PP$ is the following logic program
 \begin{align*}
  \PP =& \{a \lrule \nup(r)\mid r\in \aics, \head(r)= \add a\}\\
  &\cup \{a \lrule a\mid a \in \atoms\}
 \end{align*}
 then $\Ap = \Psi_\PP$. 

Hence, all AFT semantics for \fulldb coincide in this case with the equally-named semantics for the logic program \PP. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By case analysis on the definition of \Ap.
  The condition on \fulldb guarantees that $\suppout$ is always false.
  The inclusion of the rules of the form $a\lrule a$ is necessary to mimic the common-sense law of inertia, which is embodied in the semantics for AICs but not in that of logic programs.
\end{proof}
\luis{Proof has been done by hand.}

\begin{example}
 Proposition \ref{prop:lplink} does not hold in general, not even for unipolar \aics. 
 Consider for instance the following sets of \aics. 
 \begin{align*}\eta_1 &= \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                    a &\aicrule \remove a\\
                    b & \aicrule \remove b
                   \end{array}\right.\\
                   \eta_2 &=\emptyset.
\end{align*}
These two are not equivalent under all AFT semantics. 
For the first one, the KK-repair is $\{a\mapsto\lunkn,b\mapsto\lunkn\}$, while for the latter, the KK-repair is $\{a\mapsto\lfalse,b\mapsto\lfalse\}$. However, they have the same translation to logic programs.
