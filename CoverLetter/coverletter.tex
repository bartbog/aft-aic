\title{Cover Letter --- Fixpoint Semantics for Active Integrity Constraints}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
Thanks for the helpful reviews. We attach the revised version of our paper. 
Below we explain the changes we made, and we give our response to the criticisms raised by the reviewers. 




\section{In response to the criticisms}
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item Reviewer 2 states
	 \begin{quote}
	  ``In the current paper, we assume that, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, all AICs are normal.
Extensions of the semantics we deÔ¨Åne for non-normal AICs can be obtained through normalization, if needed.''
Well, I think that the correct way to proceed is to define the semantics for general (non-normal) AICs and
then to prove that a set of general AICs is equivalent to its normalized version wrt that semantics.
	 \end{quote}
	 We disagree with his assessment. Several of the reviewers already raised the point that notation is sometimes heavy. Restricting to the ``normal'' case, is one way to avoid even more notational blow-ups. If the only purpose of defining a semantics for a slightly larger language is showing that it coincides with our semantics for normal AICs, we do not find it worth the trade-off. To us, non-normal AICs are nothing more than syntactic sugar, and hence, are not a topic of semantical consideration. 

	 \item There was a general consensus among the reviewers that more examples are needed throughout the paper. We have taken this issue into account and added several examples. More specifically:
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item intro?
	  \item Section 4: move LP? 
	  \item ... 
	  \end{itemize}
	  
	  \item Several of the reviewers had an issue with the notational abuse $Z <-> 2^{At}$
	  \item Some reviewers complained about notation heavyness.. 
	  \item Reviewer 2 seemed to think a couple of our examples/... are wrong. However, these remarks were all due to confusion that arose because of the heavy notation. 
	  We have clarified this in the revised version (cfr also points \ref{it:abuse} and \ref{it:notation}). Some details: 
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item \begin{quote}I think that Example 6.3 is wrong. After applying U, the fact a is true in DB.
Therefore, ch a = -a.... \end{quote} and 
\begin{quote}
 Definition 6.2 is not clear. After updating a database DB with U (which is a partial action set) the
fact 'a' could be unknown, that is it's not clear whether it belongs to DB or not.
Well, in this case 'ch a' is not defined!
\end{quote}
Both of these comments are explaine by the fact that the definition of ch a only depends on DB, not on $U(DB)$, hence, if $a\not\in DB$, then  $ch a$ remains equal to $+a$, it never becomes $-a$ or unknown/undefined. 
	  \item \begin{quote}
	         Definition 5.2 looks formally wrong. If Z is the set of all possible sets of update actions, it should be a function from Z to Z (and not from $2^At$ to $2^At$).
	        \end{quote}
	         The confusion here is due to the fact that we identified elements of $Z$  with subsets of $At$ and used them interchangeably. 
	      
\end{itemize}
\item There were some more suggestions for related work. More precisely, 

	  \end{enumerate}

\section{Small changes}
 We fixed all spelling mistakes, and notational issues found by the reviewers. The only suggestions we did not incorporate are the following:
